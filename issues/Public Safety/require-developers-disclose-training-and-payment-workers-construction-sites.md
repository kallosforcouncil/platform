Two cranes collapsed while I served as Chief of Staff to Assembly Member Jonathan Bing.  Immediately following these tragedies we workd with the Building Trades to create new training requirements in order to avoid future construction accidents that unnecessarily took the lives of New York City residents.  While cranes have not collapsed since then, our campaign's vision focuses on avoiding similar catastrophe in the future by ensuring that all construction projects in New York City are built by workers receiveing the living wage, benefits and training they need to build safely for a better City.
We have worked with the Building Trades once again to propose a simple one page questionnaire for adoption by all Community Boards that would ask developers to tell the community about who will be wokring on construction sites along with how they will be compensated and trained.  We believe that even the most pro-development and ardent anti-union Community Board Member would oppose a 30 story building if were built next to them by workers being paid minimum wage with no training.  We hope that questionnaires like this one with minimal administrative burden can have a huge impact.
