    "explanation": "$52 million is lost every year as subway and bus riders discard MetroCards with leftover balances.\u00a0\nThe MTA\u2019s system of providing uneven bonuses to riders when refilling their cards leads to balances below the cost of a single fare.\u00a0 We believe this system is disingenuous, encouraging riders to add dollars that are ultimately wasted.\u00a0 This system is similar to the \u2018gift card\u2019 scam ended by the Attorney General\u2019s Office in 2007, where businesses profit from unspent dollars and cents.\nIn the case of MetroCards, the MTA rewards any amount added over $10 with a 7% bonus, resulting in amounts that cannot be spent.\u00a0 We propose the MTA offer refills by number of trips rather than amount.\u00a0 For example, 5 trips at a $2.25 fare costs $11.25.\u00a0 By choosing to add 5 trips to a MetroCard, customers would be charged $10.51 and receive a \u201cdiscount\u201d of $.74, for a total of $11.25.\u00a0\u00a0 By choosing 10 trips, customers would pay $21.03 and receive a discount of $1.47, for a total of $22.50, and so on.\nThis plan maintains the MTA\u2019s current system of rewards, and ensures riders are not cheated out of leftover balances.\nSources: http://blog.metrochange.org/post/12692925981/getting-the-most-from-metrocard",
