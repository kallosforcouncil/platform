issue: Transportation

Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is an extremely efficient and relatively cheap way to expand our mass transit system, costing only about $10 million per mile compared to the $1 to $2 billion per mile for the Second Avenue Subway. It has worked extremely well in other cities, and the Cityâ€™s BX12 line in the Bronx, our first BRT line, has been a major success, increasing ridership and decreasing travel time. We should look to barrier-off bus lanes to improve speed and service to the level of the subway system. We must also work to build a BRT system in areas that as of now have few mass transit options, even if it means they will be less crowded. In the long run, it will spur economic growth in the area and ridership will increase.
