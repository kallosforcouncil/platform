    "explanation": "The MTA loses $13 million annually printing over 170 million MetroCards.\u00a0 In an effort to reduce the financial and environmental costs of printing, the MTA plans to implement a \u201cGreen Fee.\u201d\u00a0 This year, riders will pay a one-dollar charge for printing a new MetroCard.\u00a0 The MTA claims this will raise $20 million, costing riders as much as $33 million every year.\u00a0 Riders will not be charged to replace expired MetroCards or refill old MetroCards.\nWhile we agree with the goal of reducing waste, we believe this \u201cGreen Fee\u201d unfairly penalizes those whose MetroCards become inoperable from extended use.\u00a0 Therefore, we propose that riders be able to exchange their old MetroCard for a new card at any service stall, without having to mail them to MTA.\u00a0 This has the effect of discouraging riders from discarding usable cards while not penalizing conscientious riders.",
