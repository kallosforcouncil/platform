    "explanation": "The City's private contracting budget has ballooned in the past four years from $6.7 billion to $9.2 billion. While most of this money is necessary for a well functioning government -- providing services that City workers perhaps cannot -- we shouldn't give in to the notion that private necessarily equals better. By paying civil servants instead to do some of the jobs that private contractors do, we can save money, make government more accountable and raise the morale of the City's workforce. The municipal union DC 37 has proposed $130 million in savings over eight city agencies simply by cutting down on hiring outside consultants and contractors, and instead letting city employees trained for those tasks do the work. New York State takes a different approach to outside contracting. Under a 2008 executive order, a Task Force was created to monitor outside contracting so that the State can only enter into a contract if it is necessary for public health or safety or if it is more efficient or cheaper than using state employees. We should look to create a similar program in our City.",
