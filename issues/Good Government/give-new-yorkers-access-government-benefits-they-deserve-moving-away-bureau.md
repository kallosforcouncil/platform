issue: Good Government

As outlined in “Our Next Economy: THE Creative City,” government must finally adopt a consumer oriented approach to service delivery and abandon the old method of requiring residents to jump through hoops and deal with bureaucracy in order to qualify for and gain access to benefits that they deserve. One such way would be to screen residents for benefits through routine filings such as their annual tax return. In our new consumer oriented government, taxpayers would receive pre-filled-out applications for benefits such as food stamps, heating assistance, or rent increase exemptions with their tax refunds. While demonstrating leadership on a local level, we should also support Congressman Charlie Rangel’s proposal to do the same on a Federal level.
