    "explanation": "The City of Baltimore has successfully implemented CitiStat, which requires many City agencies to produce regular reports on performance data. This data is then discussed by the mayor and officials from the agency. In addition, the data allows analysts to identify problematic trends and determine geographic areas with the greatest need for City services. CitiStat is similar to the New York Police Department\u2019s CompStat program, which has made it more effective and responsive. While the City currently has NYCStat, which compiles data, reports and statistics on every City agency, we should take the process to the next step by making the underlying data used to generate the statistics available and to use it to improve agencies and hold government accountable.",
