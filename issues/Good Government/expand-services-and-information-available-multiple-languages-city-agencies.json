    "explanation": "With people from over 200 countries living here, New York City\u2019s diversity is a great asset, economically and culturally. Film-maker Ric Burns, in his public television series \"New York,\" has written that \u201cNew York City is a continuing experiment to see if all the peoples of the world can live together in one small place.\u201d Though we may all live together, we don\u2019t all speak the same language. The 1990 census reported that 35 percent of New Yorkers\u2019 native language is not English. City government has an obligation to serve these residents, and should do it in a language they understand. That\u2019s why we must expand the availability of City services and information, both printed and electronic, in multiple languages.",
