issue: Good Government

We must take full advantage of new technologies to provide location-aware notices to New Yorkers through a centralized public notice framework. This could be accomplished by expanding “Notify NYC,” adding this information to NYC.GOV, allowing for personalized notices through “My.NYC.GOV” or through partnership with sites like “Outside.In” that provides users with location-based news from the Internet. This way New Yorkers could learn about public hearings for a noisy bar that plans to move in downstairs, application deadlines for their neighborhood school, or that a film is being shot on their street that will mean their car is likely to get towed if they don't move it in the next day or two. Location-aware notices provided through an open data centralized public notice framework will help New Yorkers engage their community and learn when and where their voice can be heard.
