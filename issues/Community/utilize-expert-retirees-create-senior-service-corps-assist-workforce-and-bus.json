    "explanation": "Especially in an economic crisis, the City needs all the talent within the five boroughs to spur economic growth. A new \u201cSenior Service Corps\u201d (SSC) is one way to tap into one of our City's major \"natural\" resources, the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of experience and intelligence held in the brains of the tens of thousands of retired business leaders who could work with City agencies and companies to assist with workforce and business development. Economic development programs like incubators would benefit from the life-long experience of senior business people who volunteer as chief financial officer, accountant, attorney, or other technical advisor, working with the a start-up firm once every week or two. Companies would gain valuable technical services and SSCs would develop a ground floor relationship with what might be the next Google or Amazon. Active SSCs who have become knowledgeable about City, State and Federal programs could be called upon to serve as economic ambassadors to attract or keep talent or companies in the New York City marketplace.",
