    "explanation": "Business leaders often know what children need to succeed in the modern economy. In addition, they have knowledge about how to manage institutions, and how to get the most out of each employee and each dollar. Let's create an \"adopt-a-school\" program, expanding the good work that is done by the not-for-profit PENCIL, for business leaders throughout the City, starting with schools most in need. Each business leader would work with the principal to improve education, and have the option of raising private funds for things such as scholarships, supplies and personnel. A close working relationship with schools would also give students a ground floor to getting a job after graduation or during the summer, and provide internship opportunities during the school year.",
