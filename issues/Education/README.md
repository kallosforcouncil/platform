# Education #

Overcrowding in East Side public schools threatens to deny a generation of children their constitutional right to a "sound basic education." We must make more school seats available now, build more schools to keep up with current development, and investigate new solutions for building educational infrastructure.I have a strong commitment to public education that stems from being a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, State University of New York's University at Albany and University at Buffalo Law School. I helped create Community Board 8â€™s Youth and Education Committee, identified a Free Yellow Bus Program for local youth service providers, and created an internship program to better serve the youth and education needs of our community. As your Council member I will continue to fight for increased funding for youth services and education.
