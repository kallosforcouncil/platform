New York City has a comprehensive sex education program that requires students receive a full education on safety, receive access to contraceptives and a semester in both middle school and high school â€“ a pioneering program in the state of New York. Schools should continue to offer lessons on sex, sexuality, safer sex and offer contraceptive devices.
This is a great start and should be expanded upon. Children must also learn basic anatomy, and what is or is not acceptable so they can keep themselves safe. Parents who sign an opt-out agreement should also be required to sign a letter agreeing that they will teach their child about safe practices so that no one gets left with no information. All NYC education should include comprehensive Internet safety classes to keep students aware and protected.

New York City does not require expansive health education that includes sex education in our public schools. Not surprisingly, teen pregnancy rates in New York City are significantly higher than national averages with HIV/AIDS still rampant and over one million young people in the City are overweight with childhood obesity alone costing the State $242 million in public and private medical expenses each year which grows to nearly $6.1 billion for obese adults. In fact, the New York State Comptroller recently found that 20 out of 30 City public schools offered junk food in direct violation of the Chancellor's policies. Similarly, studies show that teen pregnancy is one of the main causes for dropping out of high school. We must educate our children about healthy life choices, like safe sex, exercise, diet while also reducing anti-gay and gender identity-related harassment. We should continue to make condoms available in public schools and make sure to remove junk food from school vending machines while providing healthy alternatives and appetizing lunches with calorie counts posted.
