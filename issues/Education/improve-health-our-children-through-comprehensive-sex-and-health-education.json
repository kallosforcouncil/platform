    "explanation": "New York City has a comprehensive sex education program that requires students receive a full education on safety, receive access to contraceptives and a semester in both middle school and high school \u2013 a pioneering program in the state of New York. Schools should continue to offer lessons on sex, sexuality, safer sex and offer contraceptive devices.\nThis is a great start and should be expanded upon. Children must also learn basic anatomy, and what is or is not acceptable so they can keep themselves safe. Parents who sign an opt-out agreement should also be required to sign a letter agreeing that they will teach their child about safe practices so that no one gets left with no information. All NYC education should include comprehensive Internet safety classes to keep students aware and protected.",
