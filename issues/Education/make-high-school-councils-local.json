    "explanation": "Currently the City has only one high school council per borough and one citywide council. This hinders the ability of parents to give meaningful input to decisions that affect their high-school age children\u2019s education. While high school choice has removed high schools from districts, we can still give parents the opportunity to have a say in their high-school age child's education by creating a high school council for each geographic district, or making councils currently there represent students K-12 instead of K-8. This would mean that parents would have a council representing their needs even if they do not live in the district in which their child attends school.",
