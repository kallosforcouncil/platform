Many children face challenges keeping up in classes because they have teachers over-burdened with too many students and busy working parents who might be unable to help. Let’s launch a “Homework Helps” program to get these struggling students the help they need by recruiting public High School students with high grades and offering credits or a modest stipend to tutor public middle and grade school students after school. High School students would gain confidence and be instilled with the value of helping out those less fortunate and struggling students would gain a role model and the help they desperately need. This program would institutionalize a culture of students helping students and provide a cost effective way to give extra help to the students who need it.
