    "explanation": "Out of school time programs reduce youth crime by keeping them off the street while expanding children\u2019s potential through diverse programs in the arts, sports and other areas that are not offered during the school day. One example is Asphalt Green\u2019s free learn-to-swim program that offers underprivileged youth courses through its life guarding certificate and serves as a feeder to summer jobs with the Parks Department earning upwards of ten dollars an hour. The City should offer a city-wide list of all Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD), non-profit and for profit out of school time programs, online in print and multiple language so that parents and students can find appropriate programs based on age, cost and qualification. Creating this resource will benefit DYCD, non-profits, and for profit out of school time programs but also benefit our City\u2019s working families by providing safe and supervised activities for children when they are out of school.",
