issue: Education

New York City has had huge success by offering density bonuses, so that developers can build more units in existing locations in exchange for providing affordable housing or one case funding the rehabilitation of the “High Line Park.” With many of our school districts facing overcrowding, we should create scaled density bonuses for developers who provide permanent funding for the local education district or include space for schools on-site.
