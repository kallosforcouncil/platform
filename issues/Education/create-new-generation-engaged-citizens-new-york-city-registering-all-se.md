New York State voter turnout is last or second to last in the nation depending on the election with many New Yorkers fealing disengaged or apathetic about politics.  With such low voter turnout elected officials are often left to their own devices.  Acording to Citizen's Union more legislators are leaving office after criminal or ethical misconduct rather than being voted out by voters.
We can create a new generation of young people who vote by getting them in the habit early.  Starting with when they get into a public school, they will vote every Election Day in a mock election at their school using the official paper ballot that would be used by someone living at the address of their school.  That would be almost a million children voting every year.  Not only would students graduate with the habit of voting every year for 12 years in a row, but they would also learn the importance of down ballot elections (especially in non-presidential years).  We would couple the mock elections with registration of the sixty to ninety thousand Seniors in High School turning 18 before December 31, 2012 of the year they graduate.
This campaign has already launched a pilot program in select New York City High Schools:
Part I: Voter Registration
Drop Off Voter Registration Forms at Schools prior to the Voter Registration Deadline
Distribute and Register All Seniors Turning 18 Before December 31, 2012 in Social Studies Class
Collect Voter Registration Forms the Day Before the Deadline for Delivery to NYC Boards of Elections

Part II: Mock Elections
Provide a Sample Printed Paper Ballot for Each Student from Board of Elections for Students based on Address of School to be Distributed in Social Studies Classes
Hold Mock Election on Election Day (or the day before if the school is closed on Election Day) with Ballot Boxes at School Exits
Elections Counted and Results Reported by Student Volunteers

Part III: Educational Program on Voting (Optional depending on Grade Level)
Use lesson plans from Vote 18's http://Vote18.org or Rock the Vote's http://DemocracyClass.com or custom lesson plan developed by teachers.
Democracy Class taught by Teachers or Guest Lecturer

We hope to roll out the pilot to more schools by 2013.
