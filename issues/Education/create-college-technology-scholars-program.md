We should provide tuition assistance for New York High School graduates or CUNY college students who wish to earn a degree in the computer and technology field. In return, they will be required to provide technology support in our primary and secondary public schools. Our City would benefit from lower technology costs in our public schools and our "Technology Scholars" would benefit from the training they received along with hands on experience, which would help them find immediate high-paying jobs in the technology sector. Such a program would also and create an army of New Yorkers who are experts in computer technology – an Information Age GI Bill.
