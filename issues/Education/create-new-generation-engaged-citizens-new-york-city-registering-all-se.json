    "explanation": "New York State voter turnout is last or second to last in the nation depending on the election with many New Yorkers fealing disengaged or apathetic about politics. \u00a0With such low voter turnout elected officials are often left to their own devices. \u00a0Acording to Citizen's Union more legislators are leaving office after criminal or ethical misconduct rather than being voted out by voters.\nWe can create a new generation of young people who vote by getting them in the habit early. \u00a0Starting with when they get into a public school, they will vote every Election Day in a mock election at their school using the official paper ballot that would be used by someone living at the address of their school. \u00a0That would be almost a million children voting every year. \u00a0Not only would students graduate with the habit of voting every year for 12 years in a row, but they would also learn the importance of down ballot elections (especially in non-presidential years). \u00a0We would couple the mock elections with registration of the sixty to ninety thousand Seniors in High School turning 18 before December 31, 2012 of the year they graduate.\nThis campaign has already launched a pilot program in select New York City High Schools:\nPart I: Voter Registration\nDrop Off Voter Registration Forms at Schools\u00a0prior to the Voter Registration Deadline\nDistribute and Register All Seniors Turning 18 Before December 31,\u00a02012\u00a0in Social Studies Class\nCollect Voter Registration Forms the Day Before the Deadline\u00a0for Delivery to NYC Boards of Elections\n\nPart II: Mock Elections\nProvide a Sample Printed Paper Ballot for Each Student from Board of Elections for Students based on Address of School to be Distributed in Social Studies Classes\nHold Mock Election on Election Day (or the day before\u00a0if\u00a0the school is closed on Election Day) with Ballot Boxes at School Exits\nElections Counted and Results Reported by Student Volunteers\n\nPart III: Educational Program on Voting (Optional depending on Grade Level)\nUse lesson plans from Vote 18's\u00a0http://Vote18.org\u00a0or Rock the Vote's\u00a0http://DemocracyClass.com\u00a0or custom lesson plan developed by teachers.\nDemocracy Class taught by Teachers or Guest Lecturer\n\nWe hope to roll out the pilot to more schools by 2013.",
