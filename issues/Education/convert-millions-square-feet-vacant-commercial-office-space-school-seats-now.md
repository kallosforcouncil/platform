Earlier this year the Metropolitan Life Insurance ("MetLife") Company took a $38 million charge on vacant Manhattan and Queens office space such as 100,000 square feet at 1095 Avenue of the Americas and 180,000 square feet at 27-01 Bride Plaza North in Long Island City -- and MetLife is not alone. As a result of the economic crisis, New York City has millions of square feet of vacant office space. Meanwhile, we don't have enough seats for our public students and nowhere to build new public schools. Perhaps we can find an answer by studying the Millennium High School founded in 2002 and located on the 11th, 12th and 13th floors of a commercial office building. By taking advantage of commercial spaces that are dropping from $40 per square foot to as low as $18, we can create temporary and permanent schools now to alleviate current overcrowding today while we build more schools to keep up with our Cityâ€™s growing population.
