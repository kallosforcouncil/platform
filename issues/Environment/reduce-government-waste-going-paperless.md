Going “paperless” by making more materials publicly available over the Internet and upon request will cut paper, printing and ink costs for the City. Eliminating our practice of printing large quantities of City publications will reduce waste stemming from disposal of outdated materials. For example, the City should enact Introduction Number 702 of 2008 (Lappin) to create electronic pay stubs for City employees, reducing our City’s paper and ink use and saving $2 million each year. A paperless campaign, however, can’t stop at pay stubs, and we must work to expand it to all areas where we find our City government wasting paper.
