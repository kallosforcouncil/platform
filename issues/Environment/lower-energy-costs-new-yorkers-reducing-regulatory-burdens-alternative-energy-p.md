New York State currently gets the bulk of its electricity from natural gas, coal, oil, and nuclear, with only 18% coming from hydroelectric and 2% from renewable sources. With our City’s coming need for an additional 500 megawatts of electricity by 2012, and plans to provide only one-eighth of this new power, we must expand “Alternative Energy” production throughout New York City to avoid this shortfall. Our City’s rules make it difficult to install clean energy, such as windmills and solar panels. Home and business owners wishing to save on energy costs have to jump through hoops to get this done – four separate application processes, three separate inspections and the drawings of a licensed architect. Even the installation of unobtrusive small-scale windmills on rooftops requires the same application process as installing a new roof. Our City needs a streamlined application process for clean energy projects.
