Our City government has an annual $800 million energy bill, which accounts for 6.5 percent of our City’s energy use. Let's save money and the environment by gradually replacing lighting with low-energy and long-life fluorescent, compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), and light emitting diodes (LED). “Green Lighting” uses a fraction of the energy and offers 8 to 50 times the lifespan of old lighting, with LED’s lasting over 50,000 hours. Let's also install motion sensor light switches in common public areas to ensure that when our employees go out, so do our lights.
