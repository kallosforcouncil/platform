    "explanation": "Transportation 2.0 would use technology to provide commuters and businesses with live information regarding traffic delays and service changes. Bringing technology to our transit stations would provide the added benefit of increasing safety by providing cell service in subways; so in the absence of working pay phones on most platforms, if someone sees something, they can say something. And we may not be able to get the trains to always run on time, but imagine if a train sent you a text message or a visual on-platform message that it was running 15 minutes late\u00a0\u2013 or not at all due to flooding or an accident \u2013 you could stay at work generating more revenue for your family, business and the economy.",
