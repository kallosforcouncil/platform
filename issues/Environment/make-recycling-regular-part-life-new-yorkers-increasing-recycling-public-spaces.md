Our current residential recycling goal is 25 percent, although we have only reached 16.5 percent as of 2007. In order to reach or exceed our current goal, we must expand the materials that we recycle, expand availability of recycling receptacles, expand deposits on bottles, establish electronic waste and plastic bag recycling programs, investigate clean waste-to-energy projects and further explore sustainable waste export and transportation. Recycling should become widespread and proliferate throughout our City through reintroducing Introductions 673 (Lappin) and 752 (de Blasio) of 2008, which would have placed recycling bins in City schools and parks. Recycling must be a part of our childrenâ€™s youth so that they grow up recycling out of habit. While these Introductions in the City Council represent a good first step, recycling should be widespread with recycling receptacles eventually available any place our City maintains a trash receptacle. Through recycling our City can reduce waste, save money, and create jobs.
