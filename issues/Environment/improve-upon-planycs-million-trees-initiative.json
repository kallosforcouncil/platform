    "explanation": "Our City needs more trees, but not at the sake of cutting others down. A large, fully grown tree removes almost 70 times more air pollution than a newly planted tree. PlaNYC\u2019s goal of a million trees in New York must account for trees that are cut down. Tree protection should be part of the approval process for any construction project. We should make it easier for individuals and community groups to plant new trees by streamlining the permit process and providing assistance when needed. We must also seek to lower pollution and corresponding asthma rates in low-income areas by planting trees and building parks there to green our urban environment. We can raise funds for new parks and trees with the selling of naming rights for individual trees, park benches and slabs and through Tax Increment Financing.",
