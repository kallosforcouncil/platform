    "explanation": "With most power meters, the electric company comes to read the meter once a month, and then bills the consumer for that usage. A smart meter changes all that by allowing consumers themselves to monitor electricity usage and prices in real time, and adjust their usage accordingly. Smart meters will save New Yorkers money -- repaying the cost of installation after only a few years, strengthening our grid\u2019s reliability by preventing blackouts, and saving the City money by lowering power usage during peak hours, thereby pushing back the need to build new power plants. We should require the replacement of old meters with smart meters with every new renovation; new developments should be required to use smart meters; and we should require ConEd to begin replacing old meters with smart meters.",
