    "url": "https://kallosforcouncil.com/solution/environment/adopt-green-lighting-our-citys-buildings", 
    "explanation": "Our City government has an annual $800 million energy bill, which accounts for 6.5 percent of our City\u2019s energy use. Let's save money and the environment by gradually replacing lighting with low-energy and long-life fluorescent, compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), and light emitting diodes (LED). \u201cGreen Lighting\u201d uses a fraction of the energy and offers 8 to 50 times the lifespan of old lighting, with LED\u2019s lasting over 50,000 hours. Let's also install motion sensor light switches in common public areas to ensure that when our employees go out, so do our lights.",
