A smart grid provides for a more efficient, cost-saving method of moving electricity along major long-distances to the disparate end-users, using computers and sensors to better manage the flow of electricity. While New Yorkers may currently use energy generated on Long Island, a smart grid would allow our energy to come from much farther away, mitigating price hikes. A valuable side effect would be that instead of relying on customers to report power outages, outages would be discovered automatically by a smart grid. We can begin making our grid "smart" by investing funds, requiring ConEd to invest in upgrades and acquiring federal funding allocated towards smart grids. Savings would be found in cheaper electricity and in not having to pay damages to consumers who lose power. In addition, a smart grid would spur development of clean electricity projects for businesses and individuals, who would be able to sell excess power back into the system.
