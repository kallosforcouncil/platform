Thousands of children across the City suffer from chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and poor dental or vision care. The City should fund a Health Coordinator in low-income school districts to oversee a team of case managers to work in schools, linking uninsured children and children with chronic illnesses to doctors and other appropriate pediatric resources. Health Coordinators and their staff would also track sick days and new sicknesses, catching problems before they become bigger. By placing information online, and having a phone number to call, the Health Coordinator program would be a place where parents can learn about new threats to their children’s health, such as this year’s Swine Flu, and public health officials can better study trends in children's sicknesses.
