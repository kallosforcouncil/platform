During the 2004 Republican National Convention, New York City arrested 1,821 protesters and innocent bystanders, holding them in a former bus depot with asbestos fibers and chemical runoff for an average of thirty three hours in violation of the State's requirement that detainees be arraigned within twenty four hours. A 2005 estimate placed the City government's legal exposure at $859 million, with $8.2 million spent on defending eighty seven lawsuits and 557 claims remaining as of 2008. There should be steps in place for our City to automatically compensate individuals whose rights are trampled through statutory damages and a policy of automatic settlement offers. Let's start by paying individuals who are held for more than 24 hours without arraignment $1000 for every additional day they spend in detention. The individual would have the option of taking the settlement sum and forego suing the City in the future. Were this program in place for the 2004 RNC, the City could have minimized its almost billion dollar exposure and would have had incentive not to violate the law.
