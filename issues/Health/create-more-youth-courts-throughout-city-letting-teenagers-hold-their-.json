    "explanation": "Youth Courts place young offenders in front of people of their own age who decide how offenders will repay the community and their victims. Youth Courts have been shown to be more effective at reducing recidivism than traditional punishment. Red Hook\u2019s youth court, for example, hears an average of 139 cases each year, and more than 90 percent of those who go before the court complete their sanctions -- such as community service, workshops, essays and letters of apology -- as ordered. Crime in Red Hook generally has fallen faster than other neighborhoods in the City and the murder rate has fallen to zero there for several years. Youth courts also teach young people about the justice system, encouraging many to work towards joining a profession in the field. Let\u2019s expand on the success of Youth Courts in New York and create more of them.",
