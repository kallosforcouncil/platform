# Roosevelt Island #

As a third generation Upper East Sider, I have deep roots in the community including on Roosevelt Island where my grandfather, Dr. Andrew Kallos, served patients at Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital upon completing his distinguished service in the United States Armed services during World War II.As a Chief of Staff to an Upper East Side Assembly Member and longtime member of Community Board 8 Manhattan, I have kept the needs of Roosevelt Island residents at the forefront of my agenda.  Working alongside resident leaders to fight for "Democracy on Roosevelt Island" through recognition of the Governor of elections for Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation (RIOC) Board Members and "Access Roosevelt Island" to provide transportation alternatives for Roosevelt Island.I will continue to fight for responsible development on Roosevelt Island of the infrastructure improvements that will be required to better support the existing 12,000 residents as well as the 2,780 new students and faculty that Cornell NYC Tech will bring.
