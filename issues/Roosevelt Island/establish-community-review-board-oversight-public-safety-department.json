    "explanation": "There are at times incidents on Roosevelt Island involving the public safety department and residents that spark outcry from the community, as can be seen in a January 29, 2013 New York Daily News article http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/roosevelt-island-officers-beat-20-ye... and a January 11, 2013 post in the Roosevelt Islander http://rooseveltislander.blogspot.com/2013/01/rira-public-safety-committ.... In order to hold the public safety department accountable, there should be greater oversight over such incidents.\nCurrently, the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent New York City agency composed entirely of civilian employees, receives and investigates complaints against New York City police officers. The board may recommend action against police officers for alleged use of excessive or unnecessary force, abuse of authority or the use of offensive language. The board ultimately reports to the New York Police Department (NYPD) commissioner.\nIn order to hold the public safety department accountable, a community review board of Roosevelt Island residents should be established. The board would meet once a month with the public safety department to review major incidents occuring during that month. The board would be administered by the Roosevelt Island Operation Corporation.",
