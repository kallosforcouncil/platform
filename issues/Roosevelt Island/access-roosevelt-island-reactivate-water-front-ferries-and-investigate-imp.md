issue: Roosevelt Island

The need for an alternative form of transportation is evident as the F train and the Tram are at capacity during the morning commute to Manhattan. Public transportation will be more congestive as three more high-rise residential buildings are planned to be constructed in Southtown and Cornell University is set to open its new campus in 2017. Currently, Roosevelt Island doesnâ€™t have a single working dock or pier that could accommodate commuter ferry service. We hope to work with Cornell in bringing pressure on the City to expand ferry service to Roosevelt Island and allow residents to use their Metrocards on the ferries.
