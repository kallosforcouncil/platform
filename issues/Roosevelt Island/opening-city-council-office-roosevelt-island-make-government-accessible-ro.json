    "explanation": "Roosevelt Island deserves more than to have access to elected officials once a month during constituent hours or when an elected official is there for a campaign. \u00a0The City Council Member, State Assembly Member, State Senator, and Congress Member should take a joint lease on a single location where a staff could be easily accessible for any Roosevelt Island resident to just walk in get the government services they need. \u00a0\u00a0Roosevelt Island residents should not have to take a bus to a tram to a train to a bus to an office then back again,\u00a0Government should come to them.",
