Roosevelt Island deserves more than to have access to elected officials once a month during constituent hours or when an elected official is there for a campaign.  The City Council Member, State Assembly Member, State Senator, and Congress Member should take a joint lease on a single location where a staff could be easily accessible for any Roosevelt Island resident to just walk in get the government services they need.   Roosevelt Island residents should not have to take a bus to a tram to a train to a bus to an office then back again, Government should come to them.
