# Marine Transfer Station #

I am a resident of the Gracie Point and Yorkville neighborhoods and a member of both Asphalt Green and Sane Trash Solutions.  I have benefited personally from the parks where the City intends to build the Marine Transfer Station, losing over 40 pounds by running along the East River Esplanade and through regular exercise as a member of the Asphalt Green Triathlon Team so that I am no longer clinically overweight.  Asphalt Green provides a healthy and safe recreation for the youth and adults in New York City, even producing Olympians.  A residential neighborhood, let alone a fitness center and children's play field is no place for a garbage dump.
