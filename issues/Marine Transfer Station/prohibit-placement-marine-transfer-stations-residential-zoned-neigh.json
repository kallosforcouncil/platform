    "explanation": "An Industrial Plant Does Not Belong In Any Residential Neighborhood:The City proposes to build a massive industrial garbage facility, called a Marine Transfer Station (MTS), in the middle of our residential neighborhood. There are\u00a0no\u00a0other actual or proposed municipal garbage facilities anywhere in the City that are located in a residential neighborhood. The proposed MTS will be:10-stories high and cover two acres over the East River,Operating 24 hours a day, six days a week (and sometimes on Sundays),Capable of processing up to 5,200 tons per day,Accessed by a huge ramp that will literally cut in half the Asphalt Green athletic field and playground where thousands of children from around the City play.As many as 500 trucks a day will rumble up and down our local streets to dump garbage there. This industrialization of our community will increase our dangerous air pollution by at least 16%, increase noise levels already beyond legal limits, and irreparably harm the East River estuary, among numerous other harms.\u00a0 The City admits these facts in its reports.The Cost Of This Garbage Facility Has Skyrocketed Out Of Control:The City\u2019s own estimated cost of the proposed MTS has already mushroomed from\u00a0$55 million to $245 million. We expect it will cost far more\u2014up to $400 million. Why will it cost so much? The facility will be constructed from barges on the river, and be more than\u00a0three times larger\u00a0than is necessary for the 1500 tons of garbage it is supposed to handle. Rather than wasting our hard-earned tax dollars, the City should be spending this money on after-school programs, and teachers, police, firefighters and others who improve our quality of life.There Are Sane Trash Solutions:The City plans to dump garbage at the MTS and then ship that trash on barges to costly and environmentally unfriendly landfills that have not been identified yet. That multi-step, hugely expensive process, which will send \u201cgarbage barges to nowhere,\u201d is not a sane solution. It is much more sensible to continue what the City is currently doing\u2014transporting much of Manhattan\u2019s residential trash in clean air vehicles directly to a \u201cwaste to energy\u201d plant in New Jersey. The garbage is then converted to much-needed electrical energy.That is a sane solution that preserves precious resources, and answers the City\u2019s \u201cborough equity\u201d argument: other boroughs will not be absorbing Manhattan\u2019s residential garbage that is disposed of in this way. It is not equitable to single out our residential neighborhood as the\u00a0only\u00a0one in the City with an industrial municipal waste facility.",
