    "explanation": "Tax incentives like exemptions from Unincorporated Business Tax proposed in my June policy paper \"Our Next Economy: THE Creative City,\" and adopted in the City's most recent budget will provide a less costly environment for Creative Class entrepreneurs to join our City as freelancers while encouraging them to start-up a small business in their own right\u00a0\u2013 or join one. Other related high profile tax incentives that have been prioritized by \"creative class\" members like Assemblyman Jonathan Bing's and State Senator Daniel Squadron\u2019s \"Open Source Tax Credit\" should be implemented on a City level to provide developers of open source and free software products with the ability to take deductions in the same way as an incorporated business for developing the very same products.",
