    "explanation": "Our workforce development strategy must expand to encompass those who might not be \u201cwork-ready\u201d and to help them make a transition away from hourly jobs to high quality jobs that offer a career path, benefits, and a living wage. Training vouchers must be expanded to allow for residents to receive multiple grants over time. Our next workforce training program should more closely collaborate with educational institutions, employers, jobseekers and workers to provide industry-recognized training or certificates for the unemployed and underemployed who are currently actively sought by employers.",
