Over one thousand youth in New York City age out of our foster care system every year, with thousands more needing to become independent while still in their teens. In order to assist working youth in our City, we should support Assembly Member Susan John's extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to young workers ages seventeen to twenty four with increased standard deductions and deductions for student loan interest -- this would make youth eligible for an average benefit of $280. For our part, the New York City education system could integrate tax preparation into its secondary and higher education curriculum where our government should have a duty to help students file taxes and qualify for benefits like a new EITC.
