We can build “THE Creative City” with a strong creative core through a mix of targeted tax incentives, program campaigns, and education. For one example, we should continue tax incentives like the New York City Film Tax credit, expanding it to other creative industries such as the technology sector and then keep it current with competing incentives from other cities.
