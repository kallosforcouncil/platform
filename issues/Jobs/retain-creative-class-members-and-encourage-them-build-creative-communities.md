We must build creative communities by hosting or funding events for jobseekers, educators, businesses and investors in the sector.  “NY Tech Meetup” gathers almost one thousand creative class members into a room on a monthly basis to meet, greet, and share the next big ideas with other entrepreneurs, businesses, investors, and service professionals. Any one of these presenters could be the next YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter, and will generate revenues for whatever location happens to be their host. In building these communities, we can emphasize New York City’s best asset – location, location, location – by sponsoring such events to remind the creative class that this City has the resources and talent pool they need to prosper.
