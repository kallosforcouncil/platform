The Iran Divestment Act of 2012 should be strengthened and extended to prohibit any investment of the state’s pension fund or a municipality’s pension fund in companies that do business with Iran.  This will codify the existing policies enacted by the city and state comptrollers. 
Divestment must also pertain to any company holding a tie to the Iranian government’s military, as was incorporated in North Carolina’s divestment policy.
