# Israel #

I am the grandson of immigrants who fled Eastern and Western Europe because of anti-Semitism, with family that immigrated to Israel, was educated at Rabbi Arthur Schneier Park East Day School where I learned a strong Jewish identity, speak and understand Hebrew and have been to Israel many times.I believe that our City, State and Country must stand as a strong partner with the State of Israel, a close ally since its foundation.  Israel is the only Democratic and stable country in a historically unstable region of the world where, like it or not, the United States has a dependency for fuel.I stand with Israel and believe we can support democracy, freedom and peace through our efforts locally including in the City Council.
