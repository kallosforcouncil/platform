    "explanation": "The 421-a tax break costs our City budget almost half a billion dollars a year just to subsidize luxury development. An analysis by the Pratt Center for Community Development analyzed over fifty condos slated to receive the 421-a tax credit and found that of the over 6,100 units created, not one was affordable with a price lower than $350,000, with most priced above $600,000 and some exceeding $2 million, for lifetime costs exceeding another half billion dollars. We should adopt the reforms to 421-a proposed by\u00a0\u201cHousing Here and Now\u201d and its coalition of hundreds of community and advocacy groups by defining affordable housing in the context of the neighborhood, creating permanently affordable units on-site, with the requirement that all workers be paid prevailing wage. We should also consider transitioning from a geographic exclusion zone that requires an affordable housing component to a more organic community related index that would trigger affordable housing for any luxury construction.",
