    "explanation": "In order to improve accountability and ties to the NYCHA resident community, why not allow NYCHA residents elect some of their own board members? Instead of just relying on residents appointed by the mayor, we should consider allowing people who live in public housing greater agency over NYCHA governance. This would involve regular, transparent elections and would likely work in tandem with additional appointed board members.",
