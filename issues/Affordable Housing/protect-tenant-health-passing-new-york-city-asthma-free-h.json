We must reintroduce Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum\u2019s \u201cNew York City Asthma-Free Housing Act,\u201d Introduction 750 of 2008, to require owners of multiple dwellings, where a person with respiratory problems resides, to prevent and immediately remove indoor allergen hazards such as mold, cockroaches, mice, rats, and dust mites.
