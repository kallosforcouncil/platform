A 2003 study from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) states that children in New York City are nearly twice as likely to have been hospitalized for asthma as kids in the United States as a whole. We must reintroduce Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum’s “New York City Asthma-Free Housing Act,” Introduction 750 of 2008, to require owners of multiple dwellings, where a person with respiratory problems resides, to prevent and immediately remove indoor allergen hazards such as mold, cockroaches, mice, rats, and dust mites. While HPD considers some mold conditions to be a violation of the Housing Maintenance Code, there is currently no established and enforceable protocol for mold assessment and remediation.
