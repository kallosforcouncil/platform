It’s time we develop a regional transit pass – a long-delayed proposal that would be a great step toward uniting our disparate transportation systems. The MTA led the way to the introduction of EZ-Pass, and PATH riders between New Jersey and Manhattan can now use a Metrocard or SmartLink cards. We should expand on these successes and create a truly universal regional transit pass, easing congestion and headaches for commuters, both within New York and those commuting into the City.
