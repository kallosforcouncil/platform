    "explanation": "The New York City Housing Court hears over 365,000 cases per year. All of these cases are noted by tenant screening bureaus, resulting in a blacklist for any assertion of legal rights or defenses. Mirroring Assembly Member Bing's State version, this proposal would amend the New York City Human Rights Law to prohibit the use of court records to form blacklists. Tenants could then assert legal rights and remedies without fear of retaliation through the blacklist and the New York City Commission on Human Rights could enforce this new provision without forcing tenants into costly litigation to get off the blacklists.",
