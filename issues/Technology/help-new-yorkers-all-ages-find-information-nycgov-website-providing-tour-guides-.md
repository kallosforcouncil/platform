issue: Technology

Websites can be frustrating and difficult to navigate even if you know what you are looking for. For this very reason many websites offer an option to click a button for a live support person who can help guide you through the website over the phone or answer questions through an online chat. For NYC.GOV, clicking this feature could connect someone with a 311 operator in New York City from anywhere in the world. The operator would know what page the person was viewing and help them navigate the site or address the specific question or problem. NYC.GOV must keep pace with technological innovation, adopting new technologies as they become available. By providing this service, the NYC.GOV website will become more useful and 311 will benefit from lower costs and shorter call times stemming from the ability to direct people to longer, richer answers to their problems.
