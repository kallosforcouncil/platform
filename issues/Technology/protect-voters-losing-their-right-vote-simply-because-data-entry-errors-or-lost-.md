In the months leading up to last year's Presidential Election, the New York City Board of Elections was crushed under hundreds of thousands of voter registration and absentee ballot application forms to enter and absentee ballots to send out in time. However, many voters still reported that their names were not in poll books or that they did not receive their absentee ballots. The Public Advocate is a Commissioner of the Voting Assistance Commission and can advocate for legislation to allow voters to register and request absentee ballots online so we can speed up the registration process, reduce data entry errors and cut down on voters who report on absentee ballots that never arrive or are never counted.
