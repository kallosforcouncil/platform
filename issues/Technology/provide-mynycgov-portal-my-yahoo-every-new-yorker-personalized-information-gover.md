We have all become accustomed to web portals, such as AOL, My Yahoo, iGoogle or Windows Live, that allow us to personalize the information provided to us. NYC.GOV should implement “My.NYC.GOV,” as a similar portal to provide New Yorkers with access to local information that they think is important such as alternate side of the street parking, school closures, mass transit service advisories, deadlines for Department of Education school applications, and other desired information. Once New Yorkers are given an account, they should also be able to voice their opinions, create online communities, and interact online with City government. This way New Yorkers can learn and propose solutions and City government officials can listen and learn.
