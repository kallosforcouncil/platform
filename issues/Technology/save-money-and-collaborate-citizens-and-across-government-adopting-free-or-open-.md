City government spends millions a year on licenses for commercial and proprietary software products like Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Office and others when other less costly software alternatives exist. We must reform government contracting standards to recognize the value of free and open source software (FOSS) by considering its short and long term costs and comparing it to commercial and proprietary software solutions. By adopting FOSS, our City can significantly cut costs. Based on the FOSS model, anytime any agency made an improvement it could immediately benefit every other City agency, as well as the general public, using the same product.
