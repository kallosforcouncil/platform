While we build a Universal Internet in New York City, it is also important for elected officials to keep in mind that giving everyone access to the Internet doesn’t matter without “net neutrality,” which protects a person's rights to send and receive any information without limitation, and would prohibit Internet Service Providers, like telephone companies, from telling consumers who they can call and what they can say. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, said, “The neutral communications medium is essential to our society. It is the basis of a fair competitive market economy. It is the basis of democracy, by which a community should decide what to do. It is the basis of science, by which humankind should decide what is true. Let us protect the neutrality of the net.” Neither government nor corporations should censor or restrict free speech and it is only by preserving freedom of speech on the Internet that we can protect this engine of innovation that powers our economy and the wealth of opinions that are integral to a strong democracy and Government 2.0.
