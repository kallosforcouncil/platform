President Obama recently created the role of Chief Information Officer for the Federal government and appointed Washington, D.C.'s Chief Technology Officer Vivek Kundra to serve our nation. Having a city-wide Chief Technology Officer helped the District of Columbia spur the development of open and crowd-sourced software, cloud-based web applications, and led to the "Apps for Democracy" initiative. By following President Obamaâ€™s and Washington, D.C.'s lead, a New York City Chief Information Officer can help focus City Hall to make sure that New York City sees similar advances bringing about a new era of transparency, accountability and openness.
