    "explanation": "Earlier this year President Obama launched DATA.GOV in order to provide the public with increased access to information collected by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. Immediately after, the Sunlight Foundation launched\u00a0\u201cApps for America: The DATA.GOV Challenge\u201d to encourage the development of dozens of applications for people to use in understanding government information. This was based on a similar model adopted in Washington, D.C. with the \"Apps for Democracy\" initiative, an open-to-the-public contest for making government information useful, which yielded 47 web, iPhone and Facebook applications and resulted in a $2.3 million value to the City.\nIn the weeks following our initial proposal of \u201cOpen Data\u201d and \u201cApps for New York City,\u201d as a part of \u201cOur Next Economy: THE Creative City,\u201d Mayor Bloomberg has announced \u201cNYC Big Apps\u201d where members of the public would be encouraged to use 80 data sets from the City to create innovative application for a cash prize, marketing and a dinner with Mayor Bloomberg. While we applaud this effort, it falls short of \u201cApps for Democracy\u201d by failing to provide the same quality of information that is live or interactive in compliance with \u201cOpen Data.\u201d Council Member Gale Brewer has also concluded that \u201cNYC Big Apps\u201d fails to even acknowledge that the \u201cdata sets\u201d must also be released as \u201cOpen Data\u201d so that contestants and the public \u2013 not only government \u2013 can decide what information is important and what isn\u2019t as they turn it into something useful.",
