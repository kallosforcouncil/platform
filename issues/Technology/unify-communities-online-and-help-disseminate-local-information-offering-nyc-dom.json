    "explanation": "We should use\u00a0\u201c.nyc\u201d online domains to bring communities together and create a powerful tool for disseminating and aggregating information around a specific area or City topic. The Internet is increasingly central to our City\u2019s civic, commercial, community, and cultural life. While businesses have \u201c.com\u201d and colleges have \u201c.edu\u201d until now New York City has been denied access to its \u201c.nyc\u201d or \u201cdotNYC\u201d (pronounced dot-N-Y-C). But in 2010 \u201cdotNYC\u201d will become available for use by our city\u2019s residents and organizations. Our City should take care to assure that \u201cdotNYC\u201d is used in the public interest to educate and empower City residents and organizations to better connect with one another and the world. For example, by organizing our City\u2019s education resources around the Schools.nyc domain name, we can make our public, private, trade, and professional schools and our universities more accessible to our residents and to the world. ConnectingNYC.org suggests that we also think of \u201cdotNYC\u201d in terms of our neighborhoods, where we can connect with one another using names such as Astoria.nyc, Bensonhurst.nyc, and Chelsea.nyc, using \u201cdotNYC\u201d to build neighborhood identity, trust, and civic pride as residents more easily locate and network with one another to identify issues and organize for their resolution within their dotNeighborhoods. With the lack of significant number of local newspapers, the Internet can be a powerful tool for disseminating local news and opinions.",
