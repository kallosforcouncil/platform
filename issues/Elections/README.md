# Elections #

Elections are vital to preserving democracy. As a member of the New York Democratic Lawyers Council, I had the opportunity to help build a coalition of lawyers and others dedicated to fostering universal participation and trust in the electoral process by ensuring that all eligible person can register to vote easily, vote simply, fairly, without intimidation, and that all votes are counted on open and reliable voting systems. While rising to the position of State Coordination Committee Chair, I had the opportunity to organize and manage over 4,000 New York attorneys and 350 New York law students, who helped protect our right to elect Barack Obama as President and coordinate election protection for U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's first election to Congress, helping to take back the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. While working with this organization, I first discovered that over 800,000 New Yorkers had been dropped from the New York State Voter Registration List and without much time before the election, I created VoterSearch.org, to help 12 million New Yorkers verify their voter registration. Since its creation VoterSearch.org has verified voter registrations for over 35,000 New Yorkers.As Chief of Staff to Assemblyman Jonathan L. Bing, I had the opportunity to work on ground breaking legislation to allow New Yorkers to register to vote online. As your City Council member I will fight for transparent elections using a voter verifiable paper trail, open voting machines with hardware and software can be reviewed by the City or State, and accountability with the requirement that with a transition to a paper based ballot, that all optical scanned paper ballots be posted online for the people to verify and audit should they so choose.
