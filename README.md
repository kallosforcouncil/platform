NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATE BENJAMIN KALLOS

OPEN PLATFORM

This is the first political platform posted to GitHub as well as on a Drupal site where our solutions are going out to anyone who can improve them.  The way that free and open source makes computer code better is the way government code can also be made better.  

Please support our campaign for a better city, if not a better world, by reviewing our platform, and improving our policy positions on the GitHub or on our Drupal site at http://KallosForCouncil.com.

OUR CAMPAIGN ON TECHNOLOGY

Technology is the great equalizer. In a world where knowledge is power, the Internet provides access to an information superhighway where anyone can learn anything from a better golf swing to a new programming language which provides them with a marketable skill and access to new jobs.

As a student at the Bronx High School of Science, having access to the Internet gave me the opportunity to found a technology consulting firm, featured in the New York Times. My firm went on to provide services to the New York Football Giants, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, North Shore University Hospital and the State University of New York at Albany and Buffalo. After financing my education, I used these skills to found WikiLaw.org, which has recently partnered with Jurispedia.org for a global shared law, and VoterSearch.org to help 12 million New Yorkers verify their voter registrations.

As a New York City Council member I will leverage technology to make our government is transparent, accountable, and open. We will make City Hall transparent by adopting Open Government Data Principles, so that information like our laws and our budgets will be made freely available to the public to use in making government accountable with projects like Open Congress,Public.Resource.org and Project Sunlight. I will also fight to open the flood gates of knowledge by supporting our public libraries and advocating for free universal wireless so that every New York City resident has the same opportunity to learn from these valuable resources. I will also advocate for use of Open Source in government to save millions in tax payer dollars by implementing this free software, reinvigorate New York City's technology sector, and to create new jobs in a city that once boasted "Silicon Alley."

If our ideas work in New York City, they can work anywhere.  By electing an free software and open source developer we can bring our ethos into government so that it can be a better reflection of the culture that has brought us to today's future.
